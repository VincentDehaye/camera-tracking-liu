# Vincent

Finding a new implementation of faster-rcnn to make it work (after a lot of time trying to get it to run on our own computers with Sebastian), understanding how it works, what inputs and outputs it has/needs, and how to tune the parameters
* Adapt all the previous scripts to the new implementation

* Linking the pieces of code for detecting, tracking, computing distances...
* Create distance calculations script

* Trying to enhance the results and efficiency of the scripts
* Write results and discussion parts of the report

# David

* Read report about DeepTracking
* Read and understand DeepTracking implementation in Lua
* Implement DeepTracking in TensorFlow
* Training the new implementation
* Write report regarding the tracking using LIDAR data, discussion regarding
  challenges in the implementation in DeepTracking and finally a conclusion
  containing some of the insights from the project
* Record two short Youtube videos of the network running, links to the videos
  are available in the report

Also, notable is that whenever my name was used on git, that was me. I have
made contributions to the following git repositories:
